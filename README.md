## ADVANCED JAVA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Developing a multithreaded object-oriented code project using Java frameworks to determine how to deploy software applications using cloud services.

FOR SPECIFIC TASK INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS ASSESSMENT, PLEASE REFER TO THE COURSE PAGE.
## BASIC INSTRUCTIONS
For this project, I modified a Spring application with a Java back end and an Angular front end to include multithreaded language translation, a message at different time zones, and currency exchange. Then, I built a Docker image of the current multithreaded Spring application and containerized it.
